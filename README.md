# renProject interacting through a simple UI

The code base worked at some point but having some conflicting issue of dependencies and that pause deployment plus video demo. But to make submission quick, live deployment for visual interacting would be address later/sooner as the logic and concept of it all is understandable now.

## The interacting part of making dynamic minting and burning of assest from one ecosystem to another is the most exiting part for me, as that is exactly what renVM came to solve and it's most intruiging because it solve that in non very complex way that would appease a beginner in the space of blockchain technology
